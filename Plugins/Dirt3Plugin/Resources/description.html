    To enable telemetry in dirt 3 
    <li>open C:\Users\username\Documents\My Games\DiRT3\hardwaresettings\hardware_settings_config.xml</li>
    <li>find the line
        <br>
        &lt;udp enabled="true" extradata="1" ip="127.0.0.1" port="20777" delay="1" &gt;
        </li>
        <li> set udp enabled to true.</li>
    </ol></p>

<h3>Working with External Programs</h3>
<p>If you are using other software that uses telemetry like Simhub, you can have that software forward the telemetry on a different port. In which case you may enter the alternative port when clicking Start Plugin</p>

<h3>UDP Forwarding</h3>
<p>Alternatively, you can also check the UDP Forwarding checkbox to allow the plugin to forward data on a different port,  which can then be used by other software such as Simhub</p>
