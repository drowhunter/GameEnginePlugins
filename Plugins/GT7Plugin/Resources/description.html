<h2>Instructions</h2>

        <li>Start your Playstation<sup>TM</sup></li>
        <li>Start the plugin</li>

    </ol>
</p>

<h3>Working with External Programs</h3>
<p>If you are using other software that uses telemetry like Simhub, you can have that software forward the telemetry on a different port. In which case you may enter the alternative port when clicking Start Plugin</p>

<h3>UDP Forwarding</h3>
<p>Alternatively, you can also check the UDP Forwarding checkbox to allow Game Engine to forward data on a different port,  which can then be used by other software such as Simhub</p>

<h3><font color="red">Notes</font></h3>
<p>When port forwarding you may need to use the ipaddress instead of the autodisovery</p>
